// React Mini Project: Basic Music Library Viewer

// Objective: Create a simple React music library viewer that displays a list of songs with sorting and filtering functionality and implements basic role - based access control.

//   Requirements:

// Music Library View:
// Display a list of songs with attributes like title, artist, and album.
// Add sorting by title, and filtering by artist.
// Use JavaScript functions(map, filter, sort) to manage the collection.

//   Role - Based Access:
// Add basic role - based access using state to simulate roles (admin and viewer).
// Show an "Add Song" button only for admin users.

// Basic Unit Tests:
// Write unit tests for:
// Filtering by artist.
// Sorting by title.
// Verifying role - based access(e.g., "Add Song" button visibility for admin only).

//   Bonus:
// Lazy load the song list to improve performance.

//   Deliverables:

// Functional Code meeting the above requirements.
// Unit Tests covering filtering, sorting, and role - based access.
